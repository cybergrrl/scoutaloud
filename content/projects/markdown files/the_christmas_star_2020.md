description = """The star Svituška, paired with the admired Sirius, is one day cast down to earth by the jealous star Proxima. Svituška falls into a village where she is found and cared for by a teacher named Václav. Svituška has only a few days to return to the sky or she will perish. She relies on Sirius to rescue her, but intrigues by Proxima keep him away. Each evening, Václav watches the princess skating on the frozen lake and harbors a secret love for her. One night, Svituška accompanies him and, upon seeing the princess, rekindles her own light, fueled by the power of Václav’s pure love for the princess. With Václav’s help, Svituška will survive until she can return to the heavens."""
