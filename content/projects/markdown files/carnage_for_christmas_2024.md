Worried about the town’s reaction to her transition, Lola is ready to take on anyone this holiday season! However, she didn't expect that person to be a Santa masked killer - paying grisly homage to the town’s own haunted legend, The Toymaker. Now Lola - who has her own connection to the original Toymaker murders - must put an end to these gruesome murders."""
