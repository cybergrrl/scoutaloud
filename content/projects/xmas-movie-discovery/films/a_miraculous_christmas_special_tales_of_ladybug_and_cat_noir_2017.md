At least not for everyone, Adrien has to celebrate his first Christmas without his mom, and he thinks that his father is not interested in celebrating the holiday with him this year, which inspires him the idea to run away from home as Cat Noir to sing out his anger in the cold and snow. When the news of his disappearance spreads all over Paris, Adrien's friends go out searching for him while Marinette transforms as Ladybug to search the cold and snow for the boy she secretly loves. But things get worse when she accidentally causes a man dressed as Santa to get akumatized on Christmas Eve, now Ladybug and Cat Noir have to stop him before he destroys the holiday for everyone."""
