description = """In the run-up to Christmas, a family completely misses the point in trying to be good. Brechtje, the mother of the family, gets cancelled by everyone, without understanding why. Her husband, Martijn, falls in love with his younger colleague, but true love can’t be denied (or so he thinks). Justus, the son-in-law, gets lost on a Don Quichotesque quest for his masculinity. While Jos, the middle child, changes the world around with her tolerance and open mindedness – until her girlfriend wants to have a threesome. And all of that happens just before their annual Christmas dinner."""
