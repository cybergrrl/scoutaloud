description = """Five years after the events of the first film, Christmas is once again just around the corner. In a crazy turn of events, possibly brought on accidently by the brothers themselves, the director of Luke’s son Thomas’ school holiday musical steps down. Luke, desperate to make his son’s stage dreams come true, enlists the help of his brothers Taylor and Stephan. The trio also find themselves meeting their mother's new boyfriend and the brothers grapple with their own feelings about this relationship. In true Brenner brother fashion, they are all in for a Christmas they will never forget."""
