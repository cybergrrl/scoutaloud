Georgia’s work and personal life become entangled when she is caught between the charming hotel chef Luke and the sophisticated ex-prince staying at the hotel, Prince Raymond. The storylines of Georgia and the hotel’s eclectic guests twist, turn, and come together, as they unexpectedly find friendship, love, and inspiration."""
