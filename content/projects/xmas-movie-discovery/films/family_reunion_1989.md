On the way, they decide to stop at a ghost town called Sutterville which by a strange coincidence Tom has had nightmares about every year around Christmas for his whole life. Tom's father is wary & begs them not to go; however Tom's car develops a mind of it's own & takes them there only to break down so that they can't leave. Meanwhile a man arrested for vagrancy by local police is identified as Clarence McCoughlin who supposedly died in Sutterville 40 years ago, not to mention he seems to have some sort of demonic power. As the Andrews family explore the town a feeling of unease starts to takeover, Clarence escapes jail & heads back to Sutterville for a sinister family reunion..."""
