He ends up in hospital, which is where he’ll have to stay until after Christmas. Fortunately, the guy he’s sharing a room with at the hospital, Salva, is willing to step in and take on his all-important Christmas work. But it won’t be easy… the Christmas countdown clock is ticking and Salva has to find the reindeer, learn to fly the sleigh and, the most difficult part of all… learn to be a good person."""
