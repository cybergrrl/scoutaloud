description = """After an absence of three years, Aitana makes a surprise return home with Gabi, her Brazilian partner, and their son. The reception from her parents is surprisingly cold. Only her wheelchair-bound brother is pleased to see her. But what affects Aitana most of all is the presence of a stranger her age sleeping in her bed, wearing her clothes, living in her house, and being treated by her parents as if she were their daughter. From that moment on, torn by jealousy, suspicion, and misunderstanding, Aitana tries to find out what is happening and who the intruder is until she discovers an unexpected and disturbing truth darker than she would ever have thought possible."""
