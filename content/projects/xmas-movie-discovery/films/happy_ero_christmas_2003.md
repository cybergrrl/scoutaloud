description = """Byung-ki is a clumsy village policeman who helps out with trivial tasks like distributing promotional papers, though he dreams of fighting evil. One day, he runs into Min-kyong, an employee at the neighborhood bowling alley, and falls for her at first sight. However, his attempts to woo her go unnoticed. Meanwhile, Sang-doo, the boss of the local gang—with whom Byung-ki harbors a boyhood grudge—also swoons over Min-kyong and vows to take her virginity on Christmas Eve."""
