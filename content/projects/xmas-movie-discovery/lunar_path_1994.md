description = "There is only one day left until the New Year, and Little Fox still hasn’t figured out what to give to his friends. The crow advised him to climb into the attic, and there in an old chest they found the costumes of Father Frost and the Snow Maiden. At the request of the Moon Bunny, the Little Fox dressed as Father Frost and went to the Moon to congratulate the constellations gathered at the Star Ball. For this, the Moon Queen Selena granted the Little Fox's wish, giving him a bag of gifts for his friends."
