description = "The special is set in a town almost like in Disney's Lady and the Tramp, and it was Christmas Eve. In one house, a little boy named Timmy was read a Christmas story and tucked into bed. The resident mouse Gumdrop , while admiring the house all decorated for Christmas, noticed Timmy's letter to Santa on the floor. The letter must of have fallen off the table and never got mailed. So he and the family dog Gobber set outside to deliver the letter to Santa and save Christmas for Timmy."
