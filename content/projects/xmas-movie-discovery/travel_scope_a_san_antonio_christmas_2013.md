The real meaning of Christmas is most evident when he gathers with San Antonio families in their homes to honor their heritage and practice their customs in traditional ceremonies such as the Tamalada - holiday tamale making - and in the city's San Fernando Cathedral at the midnight Serenada for the Virgin of Guadalupe."
