We started towards Split about 10am.

Our first stop was Ston and those walls are truly impressive; they wind around the mountain like a crown.

We had a look around and got some breakfast and a coffee, and then went on our way again. Little detour to a winery along the road where we tried the local wine and bought a bottle to take home. 

The Peljesac bridge is a marvel of civil engineering though i can't help but feel it's also a sign of poor or failed diplomacy. But i don't know enough of the context here. I was certainly grateful not to be stopped at border crossings for a mere few kilometres of drive through Bosnia-Herzegovina.

The Makarska Riviera was maybe a little disappointing, mostly big new-builds and hotels and clubs... From what we could see. But also some pretty villages nestled into bays and climbing up mountains. 

Omis was disappointing as we failed to pay for parking due to lack of small coins. Nobody could help,  the app was only in Croatian... So we decided to give it a miss and drive on to Solin to look at some ancient ruins. We managed to get there before sunset and had a real good look around the huge amphitheatre.

Then on to Skradinski with one stop at a roadside restaurant in the middle of nowhere. We were treated to a very personalised experience as we were the only guests. Also to the full sales pitch for the local olive oil 😄
