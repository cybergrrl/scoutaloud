## Arrival evening

Well it's definitely autumn and Dubrovnik greeted us with pouring rain on and off throughout the evening.

That didn't stop us from having a great time. Crossing having alfresco dinner in a downpour and eating ice-cream under an umbrella from the bucket list üòÑ

## Our Day in Dubrovnik

### Walk the Walls

After an omelette for breakfast, we bought  the Dubrovnik card and mounted the many stairs to clinb the city walls at Pile gate. 

Now having a cappuccino and a kakao on top of the wall while listening to the water splashing against the rocks below and enjoying the sun and blue sea view :)
